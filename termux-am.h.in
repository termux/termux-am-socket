termux-am is an am alternative for most commands, implemented in the Termux app itself. 


Usage:
  termux-am [command_options]


Available command_options:
  [ -h | --help ]    Display termux-am help screen.
  [ --am-help ]      Display am command help screen.
  [ --version ]      Display version.


termux-am sends the converted string to
"@TERMUX_APPS_DIR@/@TERMUX_APP_PACKAGE@/termux-am/am.sock"
local unix socket server that is run by termux-app if enabled, which
executes it as an android activity manager (am) command from within
termux-app java process via termux/termux-am-library.

The termux-am provides similar functionality to "$PREFIX/bin/am"
(and "/system/bin/am"), but should be faster since it does not
require starting a dalvik vm for every command as done by "am" via
termux/TermuxAm.

The server normally only allows termux-app user and root user to
connect to it. If you run termux-am with root, then the am commands
executed will be run as the termux user and its permissions,
capabilities and selinux context instead of root.

The server is enabled by default and can be disabled by adding
"run-termux-am-socket-server=false" to the
"~/.termux/termux.properties"
file. Changes require termux-app to be force stopped and restarted.

The current state of the server can be checked with the
TERMUX_APP__AM_SOCKET_SERVER_ENABLED env variable.
